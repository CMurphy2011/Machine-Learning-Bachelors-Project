# Machine-Learning-Bachelor-s-Project
My Bachelor's Project on Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation. This was a project studying Self-Supervised Learning - a learning paradigm at the bleeding edge of Machine Learning. In particular, it applied it to the cameras of Self-Driving, or "autonomous" vehicles. This project was graded at First Class (> 70%).
